* Matches are sometimes double-counted as shown in the history. This may
  be due to some double-counting of the match.
* When there are multiple matches that share a card, they all get
  removed. For example this match: 7♦,2♦,2♦,2♥,2♦,A♦,7♦. It seems like
  this cleared because some a 4-of-a-kind matched and a flush was also
  matched.
* Another strange match that occured: K♣,K♥,K♠,K♥,K♣,10♠
